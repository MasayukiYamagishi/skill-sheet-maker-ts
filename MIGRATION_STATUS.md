# Database Migration Status - COMPLETED âœ…

## ðŸŽ‰ Migration Successfully Completed!

All database migration tasks have been completed successfully. The project is now fully migrated from Rust+Tauri to TypeScript with Prisma ORM.

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. Prisma Setup and Configuration
- âœ… Updated `prisma/schema.prisma` with complete database schema matching `db/schema.sql`
- âœ… All 13 table models properly defined with correct relationships
- âœ… PostgreSQL UUID extension support configured
- âœ… Proper field mappings and constraints implemented

### 2. Database Connection Configuration
- âœ… Updated `.env` and `.env.example` with proper database URLs
- âœ… Configured for `users_test` (development) and `users_prod` (production) databases
- âœ… PostgreSQL connection string format: `postgresql://devuser:password@localhost:5432/users_test`

### 3. Dependencies and Code Quality
- âœ… Generated Prisma client successfully
- âœ… Fixed missing dependencies (`classnames`, `react-icons`)
- âœ… Fixed TypeScript module resolution issues
- âœ… Code formatting applied with Prettier
- âœ… Build passes successfully

### 4. Documentation and Scripts
- âœ… Created `docs/DATABASE_SETUP.md` with complete setup instructions
- âœ… Created `scripts/init-db.sql` for database initialization
- âœ… Created `prisma/seed.ts` for master data seeding

## âœ… Successfully Completed Migration Steps

### 1. Database Connection and Schema Introspection
- âœ… Connected to existing `users_test` database from previous Rust+Tauri setup
- âœ… Used `prisma db pull` to introspect existing schema and generate Prisma models
- âœ… Schema automatically matched existing database structure with all relationships

### 2. Data Verification
- âœ… Master processes: 6 records (seeded via `npm run db:seed`)
- âœ… Skills: 235 records (already present from previous setup)
- âœ… Qualifications: 32 records (already present)
- âœ… MBTI types: 16 records (already present)
- âœ… Users: 3 records (existing test data)

### 3. Final Verification
- âœ… Prisma client generated successfully
- âœ… Database queries working correctly
- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… Next.js build successful
